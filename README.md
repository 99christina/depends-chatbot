### References and notes
This project was built following a [tutorial by Diligent Dev](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/building-a-chatbot-with-vue-js-and-aws-amplify-6e190d2e8a2e).  
Amplify folder - generated by AWS Amplify  
Public folder, assets, components, style section of App.vue - generated by initializing a Vue project  
App.vue file - followed tutorial to configure chatbot, import interactions and handle error that occurs if the bot fails. Removed confirmation for checking action success seeing as it is useful for testing but not needed when used by actual users.  
Further details of Lex usage detailed in project report.
